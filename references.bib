The method is a modification of the theta method, in which the new adaptive strategy is to automatically select the value of theta and to switch between functional iteration and Newton iteration for the solution of the nonlinear equations arising at each integration step. The criteria for selecting theta and for switching are established by optimising the permissible step size. The performance of the adaptive methods is demonstrated on a range of test problems including one arising from the method of lines solution of a convection-dominated partial differential equation. In some cases the new approach halves the amount of computational work.}

    abstract = {Summary
    Stroke is the second most common cause of death and major cause of disability worldwide. Because of the ageing population, the burden will increase greatly during the next 20 years, especially in developing countries. Advances have occurred in the prevention and treatment of stroke during the past decade. For patients with acute stroke, management in a stroke care unit, intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 3 h or aspirin within 48 h of stroke onset, and decompressive surgery for supratentorial malignant hemispheric cerebral infarction are interventions of proven benefit; several other interventions are being assessed. Proven secondary prevention strategies are warfarin for patients with atrial fibrillation, endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis, antiplatelet agents, and cholesterol reduction. The most important intervention is the management of patients in stroke care units because these provide a framework within which further study might be undertaken. These advances have exposed a worldwide shortage of stroke health-care workers, especially in developing countries.}

Two A-stable methods with algebraic order 3 and higher order of dissipation are obtained among the members of a family of methods proposed by Van der Houwen and Sommeijer (1989).

    title     = "Downstream platelet adhesion and activation under highly
                 elevated upstream shear forces",
    author    = "Rahman, Shekh M and Hlady, Vladimir",
    abstract  = "Elevated shear force caused by an anastomotic stenosis is a
                 common complication at the blood vessel-vascular implant
                 interface. Although elevated shear forces were found to cause
                 platelet aggregation around a stenotic region, transient
                 platelet exposure to elevated shear forces and subsequent
                 downstream events occurring under lower shear force were not
                 extensively studied. We hypothesize that effects of elevated
                 shear forces on pre-activation of platelets for downstream
                 adhesion and activation are relevant in understanding the
                 increased thrombotic risk associated with blood-contacting
                 devices. We designed a microfluidic flow system to mimic the
                 hemodynamic environment of vasculature with an upstream
                 anastomotic stenosis with five wall shear strain rates ranging
                 from 1620 s-1 to 11560 s-1. Under shear flow conditions,
                 transient exposure of whole blood to elevated shear forces
                 resulted in higher downstream platelet adhesion onto three
                 different immobilized platelet agonists: fibrinogen, collagen,
                 or von Willebrand factor. Platelet expression of four activation
                 markers (P-selectin, GPIIb/IIIa, lysosomal glycoprotein, and
                 phosphatidylserine) significantly increased after transient
                 exposure to higher upstream wall shear strain rates of
                 2975-11560 s-1. A significant lysis was observed when platelets
                 were primed by upstream wall shear strain rate of 11560 s-1.
                 These experimental results could be helpful to understand how
                 altered hemodynamics around an anastomotic stenosis promotes
                 thrombus formation downstream. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE:
                 Studying the downstream response of platelets following
                 transient exposure to an upstream agonist is important because
                 of significant clinical implications to the implantation of
                 vascular devices. Due to intimal fibrous hyperplasia, vascular
                 biomaterials such as synthetic small-diameter vascular grafts
                 sometimes become stenotic (narrow), leading to transient
                 platelet exposure to elevated shear forces. In this study, a
                 microfluidic flow system was developed to mimic a stenosed
                 vascular graft and to investigate how highly elevated, transient
                 upstream shear forces, typically found in severe stenosis,
                 results in the pre-activation of platelets for downstream
                 adhesion and activation. The findings of the present study have
                 implications for optimizing the design of blood-contacting
                 biomaterials in order to minimize thrombotic risk associated
                 with transiently elevated shear forces. The findings also
                 provide additional insights into the mechanisms of thrombus
                 formation at the post-stenotic regions of vascular implants.",

                 platelet transport and adhesion to biomaterial surfaces and
                 adherent platelets (hence, thrombus growth). Single-platelet and

                computationally expensive to simulate in the complex geometries
                and flow fields associated with devices. A macroscopic, continuum
                computational model is developed based on a simplified network,
                which includes terms for platelet activation (chemical and
                mechanical) and thrombus deposition and growth in regions of low
                wall shear stress (WSS). Laminar simulations are performed in a
                two-dimensional asymmetric sudden expansion geometry and compared
                with in vitro thrombus size data collected using whole bovine
                blood. Additionally, the predictive power of the model is tested
                in a flow cell containing a series of symmetric sudden expansions
                and contractions. Thrombi form in the low WSS area downstream of
                the asymmetric expansion and grow into the nearby recirculation
